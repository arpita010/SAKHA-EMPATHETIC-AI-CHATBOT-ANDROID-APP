# SAKHA-EMPATHETIC-AI-CHATBOT-ANDROID-APP

# Sakha is an empathetic AI chatbot which provides solution to your problems with reference to "Shrimad Bhagawat Geeta". 
Technology Bucket used in making this app are as following -
  1. Android for building this amazing App
  2. Spring Boot for making REST APIs
  3. MySQL Database
I've managed the backend of this project and also build the android app.
ML model for this project is build by my fellow mates. 

Hare Krishna.

Points to remember-
ðŸ”” User Authentication at the time of login(If user doesnâ€™t registered yet, he/she must have to register first and if user has entered wrong credentials , he/she is not allowed to chat with Sakha)
ðŸ”” Users cannot register with an already registered email address.
(Will add more features soonâ€¦)
